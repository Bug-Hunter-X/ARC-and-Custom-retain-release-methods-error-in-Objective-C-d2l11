The solution involves carefully reviewing and correcting the custom retain and release methods to ensure they correctly adjust the retain count.  The corrected code in `bugSolution.m` demonstrates the appropriate way to handle retain and release operations in custom methods: Ensure that the retain count is incremented in `retain` and decremented in `release`, considering potential edge cases and error handling.  Avoid modifying the retain count in ways that are inconsistent with ARC's assumptions and the standard conventions for managing object lifetimes.  If possible, refactor the code to avoid the use of custom retain and release methods altogether. This will simplify memory management and reduce the risk of errors.  This solution relies on using standard memory management within the custom retain and release methods, thus integrating properly with ARC.  Thorough testing after making changes is recommended.
