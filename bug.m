In Objective-C, a rare but impactful error arises when dealing with memory management and the interaction between ARC (Automatic Reference Counting) and custom retain/release methods.  Consider a scenario with a class that implements custom retain and release methods, overriding the default behavior of ARC. If these custom methods contain logic errors or fail to properly manage object lifetimes, it can lead to unexpected crashes, memory leaks, or double-free errors. For example, improperly incrementing or decrementing the retain count in the custom retain or release methods can lead to these issues. The issue becomes more subtle when interacting with other objects and the intricacies of ARC's reference counting mechanisms.  Debugging such errors can be challenging as the problem might not manifest immediately and might only surface under specific circumstances.
